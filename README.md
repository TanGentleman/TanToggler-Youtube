A Browser Extension for an enhancing Youtube.com

### Features
Content.js is a script that makes your Youtube experience consistent and optimized, even on incognito or after clearing cookies.
I use it to disable autoplay by default, and to toggle maximum resolution when starting a video, instead of the "Auto" annoyance.

### Installation
In progress - I'm gonna make the config file more user friendly and optimizate a bit before releasing this project.
